                    <div class="right-column"><p>My name is Asbjørn lyck and I am a young developer living in Copenhagen. My core competencies are in concept development and frontend development, but lighter backend development isn't far behind. As so i enjoy to work as a full-process developer, contributing to all the phases of a project evolving.
I'm humble, thoughtful and always willing to give that extra 10%. In return i just expect to be treated with respect and gratitude. Below i've listed some personal traits relevant for you:<br><br>
<strong>Researching:</strong> Im a strong believer that proper preparation is key to a good execution. As so I like to keep a broad perspective and research all areas necessary for a project to succeed.
This process comes natural to me as i love to dive in and learn.<br><br>
<strong>Concept development:</strong> I see myself as someone who has a great understanding of people, their behavior and their needs. This is necessary because a great product will only be successfull if people use it.<br><br>
<strong>Communication:</strong> I’m good at reading people and understanding their strengths and weaknesses. I'm also good at conveying information in a way that matches the receiver. This makes it easy for me to work with other people and in groups.<br><br>
<strong>Execution:</strong> I only do something with the intend to do it good. Knowing ones strengths and weaknesses will be key to a great execution because it enables a team to manage and optimize tasks accordingly.</p>

                    <p>When you have a tough task ahead of you, you take to your specific set of skills to deal with that task. Through time and education i have a acquired a skillset that i am very proud of: I can understand the strenghts and weaknesses of most businesses and their strategies. I also have the skills to create the visual layer between businesses and their customers, ensuring the right brand identity is created. On top of that I also have the technical knowhow to implement these skills into a web project. <br> Finally i want to mention that i know my own limitations. Why would I mention this? Becouse if you dive in heads first, without recognising your own or your teams limitations, then the final product will be a result of that and the path towards the finish line can get prolonged. Therefore I believe it to be a valuable asset to know ones personal limitations.

            <h1>The dallr project</h1> 
            <p>dallr is a company workspace platform for internal communication - We did everything from concept development and market analysis to beta development and testing. The process was increadibly interesting although it did requirea lot of hard work. The beta system was built with Node.js, NginX, CakePHP, Js.+jQuery, Amazon webservices and MongoDB and supported functionality for instant chat messaging, file sharing, interactive task management, wallposts and elaborate filter options.</p>

                    <p>Being a developer in these years has become both increasingly easy but also increasingly overwhelming. we have so many helpful tools to chose from, tools that can make our work both faster and easier, but we have so many possibilities that it is impossible for one man to know them all. So do you  specialise in a few tools or do you take in as much as possible in an attempt to never miss out? Personally i like to find a few key tools to focus on. Tools that i belive will be in demand and be around for a long time, but also tools that have similarities with other prominent tools, so that i might take knowlede with me from one tool to another.<br>At the moment i'm very excited about angular and node.js - they are hot new tools, they will be around for a long time and they use javascript to make the magic happen, so they will never be a waste of time.   </p>
